Reactive programming can improve scalability and resource
utilization.
  1. It is not synchronized with the tread execution, so no of thread is minimal say one.
  2. Each call back happens on the same thread as on when the wait is over.
  3. Single threaded execution results in high through put. Thread context switch is avoided.
  4. No locking happens as all execution happens in a single thread.
  5. Resource utilixation is also maximized.
